#### Description

I carried out a study of the competition for the creation of the brand. I chose a color palette consistent with the type of business. A logo was designed in accordance with the client's requirements and with modern standards, for that I used the Adobe Illustrator software, I also performed image treatments with the Photoshop software before adding them to the website.
A website was developed using the NEXT JS technology so it uses HTML, CSS and Javascript. It was also necessary to use API for some functionalities. I also optimized the code for better SEO positioning
